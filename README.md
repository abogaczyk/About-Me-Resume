# About Me  

Hi! My name is Alyssa Bogaczyk. I am currently finishing my MBA in Data Science and actively looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and business strategy.  

This GitHub is where I share my work and projects as I continue to grow in my career. Right now, I have two larger projects published here that you can check out, with more on the way as I keep building.  

I’ve also included my resume in this repository if you’d like to take a look at my background and experience.  

Thanks for stopping by!
